## TO RUN
Visit chrome://extensions and make sure you are in developer mode. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `/chrome_extension` folder where our chrome extension lives. Now try out the addon!

## TO DO
- Convert from ReactJS to Chrome Extension (may need to play around with key event listeners and override input values)
- Get the webpage messaging from react to foreground.js working so that we can do things like minimize the panel, move it to the left/right, open it... etc
- Ability to open/close the panel via browserbutton or rightclick contextmenu. plus memory of it being open or closed.
